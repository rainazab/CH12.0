### Problem Statement
The AI API ecosystem is crowded and constantly changing. Prices shift, features get deprecated, and performance evolves overnight. Developers waste time digging through docs and forums without a clear, historical view of how an API has performed. There's no reliable, data-driven way to compare APIs over time and make informed decisions.

---

### Solution Statement
Build a platform that aggregates and benchmarks AI APIs across cost, latency, accuracy, and scalability, while using an AI component to analyze each API's history and evolution. Developers can view trends like pricing changes, model improvements, and downtime frequency to choose APIs based on both current performance and long-term reliability.
