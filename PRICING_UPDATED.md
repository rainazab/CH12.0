### **Recommended Description:**

```
Rho is a SaaS platform that helps developers discover, compare, and integrate APIs. 
We offer a subscription service with three tiers:
- Free Plan: 1 API comparison per day with basic features
- Pro Plan ($10/month): Unlimited comparisons, advanced features, priority support
- Enterprise Plan: Custom pricing for teams with dedicated support

Users pay monthly subscriptions through Stripe for Pro and Enterprise access. 
The platform aggregates data on AI APIs (GPT-4, Claude, DALL-E, Midjourney, ElevenLabs, etc.) 
and displays cost, latency, uptime, and performance metrics to help developers make informed 
technology choices.
```

**Category**: Software as a Service (SaaS)

## 🎯 What Changed

### Before
- Free: 5 comparisons per day
- Description: "Perfect for getting started"

### After
- Free: 1 comparison per day ✨
- Description: "Perfect for trying Rho"

## 💡 Why This Makes Sense

✅ **Encourages Upgrades**: Users quickly hit the 1-comparison limit and upgrade to Pro
✅ **Sustainable**: Reduces server load and API costs
✅ **Fair Trial**: Still allows users to test the platform
✅ **Clear Value**: Pro plan ($10/month) shows strong value proposition
✅ **Professional**: Standard SaaS pricing model
